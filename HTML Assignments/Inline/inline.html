        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
        <img src="C:\Users\sdf\Desktop\Home-Automation-Benefits.jpg" alt="Home automation" align="right">
        The above example shows very simple usage of the <img> element. The src attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.The alt attribute contains a textual description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful for accessibility — screenreaders read this description out to their users so they know what the image shows, and it is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason.There are many other attributes that can be specified to achieve various purposes.
